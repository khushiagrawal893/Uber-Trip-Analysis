# ⭐ Uber Trip Analysis — End-to-End Power BI Dashboard

An interactive and analytical dashboard built using **SQL + Python + Power BI**, designed to uncover patterns in Uber trip behavior, identify peak hours, visualize hotspots, check data quality, and highlight operational insights.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
This end-to-end analytics project walks through the full data pipeline:

1. **SQL** — Data extraction, cleaning & transformations  
2. **Python** — Deeper cleaning, feature engineering, anomaly detection  
3. **Power BI** — Interactive dashboard & storytelling visuals  

It reveals key insights such as:
- Peak travel hours and weekday patterns  
- Trip purpose distribution  
- Geographical hotspots  
- Forecasting trends  
- Data quality gaps  
- Outlier & anomaly detection  

> **Key finding:** *503 trips (~43%) were missing a trip purpose*, significantly impacting segmentation and business categorization insights.
